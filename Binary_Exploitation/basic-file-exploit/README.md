# basic-file-exploit
**Category**: Binary Exploitation \
**Points**: 100

## Problem Statement
> The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat: \
`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681` \
The program's source code with the flag redacted is in __program-redacted.c__.

## Hints
1. > Try passing in things the program doesn't expect. Like a string instead of a number.

## Solution
Analyzing the code in __program-redacted.c__, we realize that we can get the program to output the key if we set the `entry_number = 0`.

## Flag
```
picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_E0394EC0}
```
