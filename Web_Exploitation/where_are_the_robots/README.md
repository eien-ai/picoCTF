**Category**: Web Exploitation \
**Points**: 100

## Problem Statement
> Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

## Hints
1. > What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
Refer to https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro

> A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google.

Navigating to https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/robots.txt shows an url path containing the key.
